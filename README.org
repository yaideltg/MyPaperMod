#+title: Another modified version of PaperMod 
#+author: yaideltg

This is yet another modification to the PaperMod Hugo theme. I customize it to my needs, removing everything I
found unnecessary. 

* Making it work on your own site

I have included an example site (see =exampleSite= folder). To make it work, you just need to copy all the
theme folders, i.e. excluding =exampleSite=, into =/exampleSite/themes/PaperMod/=. Another alternative is to use
links, like

#+begin_src shell
  cd exampleSite/theme
  ln -s ../../../PaperMod
  hugo server -D --noHTTPCache --disableFastRender --navigateToChanged
#+end_src
