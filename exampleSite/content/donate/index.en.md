This blog does not track any user, neither it makes advertising, and it is as lightweight as I was able to
make it. All the content is completely free as in *libre* and free as in *gratis*.

## Affiliate links

A good way of support is throughout Affiliate Links. The services proposed here are, as far as I know,
respectful with the user's freedom and privacy.

- [Tutanota affiliate link](https://mail.tutanota.com/signup?ref=bERxZ0FHUmk): email service which respects
  and fight for the users privacy and rights.
  - The price is 12 euros per year.
  - For a year subscription with this link you get a free month, and I get the 25% of that year's payment
  (i.e. 3 euros). See [detailed conditions](https://tutanota.com/faq#refer-a-friend).
